# Data Splitting

The train-test split is a technique for evaluating the performance of a machine learning algorithm.

1. It can be used for classification or regression problem
2. Can be used for any supervised learning algorithm.

The procedure involves taking a dataset and dividing it into two subsets. The first subset is used to fit the model and is referred to as the training dataset. The second subset is not used to train the model; instead, the input element of the dataset is provided to the model, then predictions are made and compared to the expected values. This second dataset is referred to as the test dataset.

I have used Linear Regression from skLearn to train my model
